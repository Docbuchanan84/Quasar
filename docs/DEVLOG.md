# Development log

Keep concise entries for completed work. Include the date, result, validation,
decisions/pending questions, and one next step. Commit the entry with the related
change so Git history and notes remain connected. This is an implementation log;
the owner's shared Google Doc remains the design discussion record.

## 2026-11-08 — Public repository and version-control foundation

- Owner approved a public GitHub repository and explicitly chose MIT licensing.
- Prepared `main`, a reproducible CI verification workflow, contribution guidance,
  and this ongoing development log. Actions are pinned to reviewed commit SHAs.
- Separated private deployment addresses, owner-only source access, and full
  document snapshots from the public source. Local copies remain recoverable.
- Existing foundation: headless C#/.NET 10 library; ASP.NET serving a built React
  skeleton and read-only health endpoint; React/Babylon.js/PixiJS approved roles.
- Mobile play is a pillar; the owner confirmed the private skeleton on iPhone 17
  Pro. No simulation clock, game-state API, maps, or persistence exists yet.
- Validation: local build/format/lint/type/bundle and renderer checks pass. The
  initial [GitHub verification run](https://github.com/Docbuchanan84/Quasar/actions/runs/42510877465)
  passed on a fresh Windows runner. Anonymous Git access and connected-plugin
  README readback were verified; the working branch tracks its GitHub remote.
- Repository controls: PRs and passing up-to-date `verify` checks are required on
  `main`, including for the owner; force-push/deletion are blocked. Squash merging
  and merged-branch cleanup are enabled. Secret scanning/push protection and
  dependency vulnerability alerts are enabled. A solo owner is not required to
  obtain an impossible self-approval.
- Limit: private hosting currently uses a foreground process; unattended startup
  remains unresolved. The simulation test project has no behavior tests yet.
- Next implementation task: the minimal headless universe clock with focused
  behavior tests. Durable private hosting is a separate operational follow-up.
